# FPAssistant ARINC 424 Parser

This is an example of how to use the ARINC 424 Parser built, as a API module, within the FPAssistant Suite SDK; a Microsoft .NET library of API's specifically for aviation software developers giving a comprehensive set of API's fully tested through 1000's of unit test cases; this included test data from ICAO, FAA and Eurocontrol.

The ARINC 424 Parser API is a module that allows simple access to a ARINC 424 navigation database file by parsing the records into a series of .NET objects (classes & structs). The full SDK documentation [click here](http://api.fpassistant.com/)

This Microsoft Windows 11 desktop example is written in C# using the Microsoft Win UI 3.x tool (Windows SDK App) developed using Microsoft Visual Studio targetting .NET 9, other examples in this GitHub organisation use other Microsoft GUI tools (WinForms, etc).

This example will be worked on but if you need a specific feature or be shown how to access particular navigation data then please make contact and our dev team will help you.

Below is a screen shot of the app showing the ARINC 424 Record types in the left pane and when clicking on a tree node, the ARINC 424 record data will be shown with the field decription and the value.
