# FPAssistant ARINC 424 Parser

This is an example of how to use the ARINC 424 Parser built,as a API module, within the FPAssistant Suite SDK; a Microsoft .NET library of API's specifically for aviation software developers.

The ARINC 424 Parser API is developed using the FPAssistant SDK and this module allows for access to a ARINC 424 navigation data file by parsing the records into a series of .NET classes, records and objects.

This Windows desktop example is written in C# using the Microsoft Win UI 3.x tool, other examples in this GitHub organisation use other Microsoft GUI tools (WinForms, etc).

This example will be worked on but if you need a specific feature or be shown how to access particular navigation data then please make contact and our dev team will help you.

Below is a screen shot of the app showing the ARINC 424 Record types in the left pane and when clicking on a tree node, the ARINC 424 record data will be shown with the field decription and the value.
