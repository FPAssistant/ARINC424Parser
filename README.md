# FPAssistantArinc424Parser

This is an example of how to use the ARINC 424 Parser built within the FPAssistant Suite SDK; a Microsoft .NET set of API's for aviation developers.

The ARINC 424 Parser is developed using the FPAssiatnt SDK and this module allows for access to a ARINC 424 navigation data file by parsing the records into a series of .NET classes, records and objects.

This example is written using the Microsoft Win UI 3.x tool, other examples in this GitHub organisation use other Microsoft GUI tools (WinForms, etc).

This example will be worked on but if you need a specific feature or be shown how to access particular navigation data then please make contact and our dev team will help you.
